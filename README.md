## Pandas Documentation Sprint Ghent

On March 10th, the Pandas community is organizing a worldwide documentation sprint! https://python-sprints.github.io/pandas/

A Ghent event will be held at the *Atelier*, the headquarters of [@MichielStock](https://github.com/MichielStock).

Please sign up for the sprint. Seats are limited to 15 attendees!

### What we'll do

Contributors throughout the world are going to improve Pandas' documentation. Each contributed hour has the potential to transform countless collective hours of difficulties into as many hours of productive work. This is a great opportunity to learn from fellow programmers, to learn more about Pandas and to have a significant impact on data science.

### What to bring

A laptop. Ideally with Python (2.7, 3.5 or 3.6) installed, along with the Pandas library, and Git. We will provide wifi!
